# map_demo
A demonstration of a map that has an overlay of a bus moving in what could be real-time.  This would be very useful in an app for example that shows a user where a bus is relative to their current position.

To use this:
 * Clone this repo.
 * From the cloned directory, drag the index.html file into a web browser.  It's that easy!
